/*Given a stack s, delete the middle element of the stack without using any additional data structure.

Middle element:- floor((size_of_stack+1)/2) (1-based indexing) from the bottom of the stack.
Note: The output shown by the compiler is the stack from top to bottom.

Examples:

Input: s = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Output: [50, 40, 20, 10]
Explanation: The bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 50. Middle element will be element at index 3 from bottom, which is 30. Deleting 30, stack will look like {10 20 40 50}.
Input: s = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Output: [40, 30, 10]
Explanation: The bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 40. Middle element will be element at index 2 from bottom, which is 20. Deleting 20, stack will look like {10 30 40}.
Input: s = [5, 8, 6, 7, 6, 6, 5, 10, 12, 9]
Output: [9, 12, 10, 5, 6, 7, 6, 8, 5]
Constraints:
2 ≤ element of stack ≤ 105
2 ≤ s.size() ≤ 104
