/*Given a circular integer array arr[], the task is to determine the next greater element (NGE) for each element in the array.

The next greater element of an element arr[i] is the first element that is greater than arr[i] when traversing circularly. If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Note: Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, the search continues from the beginning until we have looked at all elements once.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation:
The next greater element for 1 is 3.
The next greater element for 3 is 4.
The next greater element for 2 is 4.
The next greater element for 4 does not exist, so return -1.
Input: arr[] = [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output: [2, 3, -1, 2, 2]
Explanation:
The next greater element for 0 is 2.
The next greater element for 2 is 3.
The next greater element for 3 does not exist, so return -1.
The next greater element for 1 is 2 (from circular traversal).
The next greater element for 1 is 2 (from circular traversal).
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
