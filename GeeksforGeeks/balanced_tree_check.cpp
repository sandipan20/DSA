/*Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced or not.

Note: A binary tree is considered height-balanced if the absolute difference in heights of the left and right subtrees is at most 1 for every node in the tree.

Examples:

Input: root = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60]
    
Output: true 
Explanation: The height difference between the left and right subtrees at all nodes is at most 1. Hence, the tree is balanced.
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, N, N, 5]
   
Output: false
Explanation: The height difference between the left and right subtrees at node 2 is 2, which exceeds 1. Hence, the tree is not balanced.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 1000
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 104*/
