/*You are given an integer n.

An integer is called Monobit if all bits in its binary representation are the same.

Return the count of Monobit integers in the range [0, n] (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 1] have binary representations "0" and "1".
Each representation consists of identical bits. Thus, the answer is 2.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 4] include binaries "0", "1", "10", "11", and "100".
Only 0, 1 and 3 satisfy the Monobit condition. Thus, the answer is 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 1000*/
